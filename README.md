This is a react & typescript project to create a basic to do list

Features :
1. List existing To Do Items
2. Add a new To Do Item

Trade-off :

As I had very limited time to finish this test, there are few trade-offs that I decided to make:

1. Clean code: Yes
2. Error handling : No
3. TDD: Yes
4. Database connection: No (static initial To Do List)
6. Clean code: A big Yes!
